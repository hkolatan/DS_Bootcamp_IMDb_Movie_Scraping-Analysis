# IMDb Movie Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing the data obtained from the IMDb website using web scraping method and predicting the ratings of movies with a series of linear regression models.

## Data Sources

* IMDb: We will scrape movie data from the IMDb website, which is one of the most comprehensive sources for movie information.

## Tools and Techniques

* Web scraping with beautifulsoup: We will use this Python library to extract data from the IMDb website.
* Selenium: We will use this Python library to automate the scraping process and make it more efficient.
* EDA: We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify patterns.
* Linear regression: We will use linear regression to build a predictive model that can recommend movies based on our viewing history.
* Feature engineering: We will create new features from the existing data to improve the accuracy of our predictive model.

## Deliverables

* Presentation File: We will create a visual and oral presentation to showcase our project and findings.
* Project Repository: We will create a GitHub repository to share our code and project details.
* Blog Post: We will publish a blog post on the internet (e.g. Medium) to share our project and findings with the broader data science community.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into what kind of movies we would love to watch as a team based on our Netflix view history and IMDb data. We will use a combination of web scraping, exploratory data analysis, linear regression, and feature engineering to build a predictive model. Our project will showcase our data science skills and provide us with valuable experience in working with real-world datasets.
